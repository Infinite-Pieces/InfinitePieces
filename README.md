# Project Goal

The goal of this project is to create an interactive web platform that allows users to design and purchase custom AI-generated images on various printed items. Users can create an account, use DALL-E to produce unique images, and then select items like shirts, mugs, puzzles, and posters to feature their custom designs.

The project includes a frontend built with React and a backend powered by Node.js for handling account creation, AI requests, and order management. PostgreSQL serves as the database for managing user data and orders, while NGINX functions as a reverse proxy to route API requests efficiently between the frontend and backend.

To ensure code quality, both the frontend and backend codebases are checked with ESLint, which is automatically triggered on every pull request to the main branch. This setup helps maintain clean and consistent code standards across the project.

Overall, this project combines AI-powered creativity with a seamless e-commerce experience, allowing users to design, personalize, and purchase custom AI-generated artwork on-demand.

We hope you like it,
