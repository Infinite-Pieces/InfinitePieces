# Infinite Pieces - Setup Instructions

This README provides step-by-step instructions to set up and run the Infinite Pieces project on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (version 14 or later)
- npm (version 6 or later)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:


2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd infinite-pieces
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   This command will install all the necessary dependencies listed in the `package.json` file.

## Running the Application

To start the development server and run the application, use the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This command will start the development server and provide you with a local URL (e.g., `http://localhost:5173`) where you can access the application.

## Accessing Routes

After starting the server, you can access the following routes in your browser:

- Dashboard: `http://localhost:5173/`
- Login: `http://localhost:5173/login`
- Checkout: `http://localhost:5173/checkout`
- Account: `http://localhost:5173/account`

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while setting up or running the project, try the following:

### Path Alias Errors (@/)

If you see path alias errors related to `@/`, update the `vite.config.js` file and ensure the path alias is properly configured:

```javascript
resolve: {
  alias: {
    '@': path.resolve(__dirname, './src'),
  },
}
```

### Tailwind Styles Not Working

If the Tailwind styles are not being applied correctly, try the following:

1. Make sure the `index.css` file is imported in `main.jsx`.
2. Verify that the content paths in `tailwind.config.js` are correct.
3. Run `npx tailwindcss init -p` to regenerate the configuration files.

### Component Import Issues

If you encounter issues with importing components, consider the following:

1. Check the file extensions (`.jsx` vs `.js`).
2. Verify that the import paths are correct.
3. Ensure that all dependencies are properly installed.
